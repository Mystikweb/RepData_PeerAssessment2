When exploring changes to a population's health and economy, one of the reasons a change occurs can be due to a severe weather event. In this article, we examine the affects different types of weather events in the United States. We will look at the total number of injuries and fatalities along with the total cost of damages incurred due to the different types of weather events and determine which type has had the greatest overall impact. The information used for the evaluation comes from data collected by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) between 1950 and 2011.
